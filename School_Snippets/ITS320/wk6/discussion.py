# Notice that the results will vary wildly based on resources available to the script
# Even within the same computer and terminal, results will likely always vary and flunctuate. 
# It's about noticing the pattern and estimating range of performance rather than focusing on an specific time value. 

# One of my Sample Outputs:
# ðŸ“‹ List Operations
# Appending an element to a list of 1 million items: 5.97000 ms
# Inserting an element at the beginning of a list: 5.54609 ms
# Removing the first element of a list: 2.10166 ms
# Removing the last element of a list: 0.00095 ms
# Accessing an element in the middle of the list: 0.01907 ms
# __________________________________________________
# ðŸ”‘  Dictionary Operations
# Adding an entry to a dictionary with 1 million keys: 0.00191 ms
# Removing a key-value pair from the dictionary: 0.00095 ms
# Looking up a value in the dictionary: 0.00310 ms

# Notice how INSERTIONS are the heaviest actions you can perform on an list.
# This output was specially critical too! 
# The average results on most executions was around 2ms, but this one reached up to 5ms!

# Surprisingly, the most consistently efficient process in the list was Removing the last element
# I knew it was a fast process, but I was shocked to see it consistently performing better than the Lookup itself

# There was even an execution in which we got almost 0ms for deleting the last item in list! 
# whereas lookup was still around 0.009, and the deletion for the dictionary was around 0.004

# Removing the last element of a list: 0.00000 ms
# VS
# Accessing an element in the middle of the list: 0.00906 ms
# Removing a key-value pair from the dictionary: 0.00405 ms

# Impressive! 

# The results for dictionary was pretty predictable and straightforward.
# However, they were not significant and important! 
# They were consistently low and never reached 1ms for ANY operation. 

# These consistently high-performing results are what makes dictionaries amazing data structures to work with.
