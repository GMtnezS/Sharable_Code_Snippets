When the program starts, the user is presented with a main window that has a horizontal navigation menu at the top containing the four buttons. 
The center of the window is a scrollable display area where the date/time messages get shown.
 (after trying different text box alternatives, I ended up using a JTextPane as it's the one that felt the most natural). 

When the user clicks "Show Date & Time", the current date and time is appended to the display in italic, centered text. 
Notice you can ask as many as you'd like, and it allows for scrolling when there's too many. 

Clicking "Save to log.txt" writes the current contents of the text pane to a text file named log.txt, nothing fancy here.

Clicking "Green Background" changes the background color of the center panel and text area to a randomly generated green hue.
You can continue clicking the button to try out different random hues until you find the one you like. 

Finally, clicking "Exit" prompts the user with a confirmation dialog. If the user confirms, the program closes; otherwise, it returns to the application window.

CLASS HueApp:
  PRIVATE STATIC JTextPane textPane
  PRIVATE STATIC Color randomGreen

    FUNCTION appendCenteredText(text):
      Get StyledDocument from textPane
      Create and configure SimpleAttributeSet with:
      ALIGN_CENTER, Italic font, Font size 20, Set foreground color
      Insert text and apply paragraph attributes

    FUNCTION showExitConfirmationDialog(frame):
      Display confirmation dialog:
      "Are you sure you want to exit?"
      IF user selects YES: frame.dispose()

    FUNCTION generateRandomGreenHue():
      To get green, generate random RGB values with: Low red, High green, Optional blue tint
      RETURN new Color(r, g, b)


    FUNCTION main():
      Create main frame titled "Hue App"
      Set default close operation, size, and layout
      Create and configure textPane for styled, read-only, scrollable text display
      Wrap textPane in JScrollPane and add to a JPanel with GridBagLayout for vertical centering
      Add this center panel to frame.CENTER

      Create Navigation Bar:
        Instantiate a JPanel with FlowLayout
        Create buttons: showDateTimeBtn, saveToFileBtn, changeColorBtn, exitBtn
        Add all buttons to the nav bar
        Add nav bar to frame.NORTH

      Button Behaviors:
        ON showDateTimeBtn CLICK: Get current datetime; CALL appendCenteredText(now)

        ON saveToFileBtn CLICK: Write contents of textPane to "log.txt"; Show confirmation dialog

        ON changeColorBtn CLICK: Generate a random green hue; Set background color of center panel, viewport, and textPane

        ON exitBtn CLICK: CALL showExitConfirmationDialog(frame)
